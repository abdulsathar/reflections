Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	
	When we initialize a repository we are starting the process of keeping track of the changges in the  folder we just initialised.We initislize  a repository when we start a new project or when we need to create a history of commits to track the peogress.

	
Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


	Staging area offers the freedom selecting the initial commit to be done by selecting individual files or a group according to our wish.


Q. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?


	Using 'git diff' and  'git diff --staged' we can easily identify the changes done to the files before commit. So ini a sense Staging area creates a platform to identify the changes and make commit accordingly. thus we can achieve one commit per logic.

Q.  What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?


	Branches help us in organising different variations that we commit to the code whether to experiment a new feature or to try out different codes. We can easily track these from the history in the repository. 
	Master branch can be used where we present it publicly and the development. This branch will always work without any problem.
